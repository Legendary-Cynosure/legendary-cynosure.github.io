Assert
=======
By [Alexander Le](https://github.com/physicist86)

## General

Assert is a tester that is usefull to ensure stability and strength in the sructure of your code. For example, putting assert to test the type of arguements is a great way to ensure that everything goes as planned, preventing brittle code.

-----------

Here's a simple example:

```javascript 
// import it
import Assert from "../../Core/Assert.min.js"; // (the path might be different)


// Since it is static, you don't have to make a instance of it.
var variable = ... 
Assert.assert( typeof variable === "number", "error message" ); 
// this will make sure variable is a number type, or it will throw a error

```
